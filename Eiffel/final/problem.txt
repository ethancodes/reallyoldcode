		The Random Walk Bug Problem

	The Random Walk Bug Problem places a bug on the tiled
floor of a room. The room is square, such that the floor is a
matrix that is x tiles in length by y tiles in width, where x
and y are defined by the user.
	The bug begins in the middle of the room and moves at
random to one of the tiles surrounding the tile the bug is
currently on. The bug cannot climb walls, thus the number of
legal moves changes as the bug moves.
	The bug begins with legal moves in eight directions;
those being to the upper left, straight up, the upper right,
left, right, lower left, down, and lower right. If one of
these moves places the bug outside or on the wall, that move
is illegal and cannot be made. Therefore, if the bug is next
to a wall it only has 5 moves, none of which cross the wall;
if the bug is in a corner it has only three moves.
	The problem is to find the number of moves it takes the
bug to make until it has touched every tile on the floor, 
assuming that a illegal move cannot be made and therefore 
does not count as a move.
